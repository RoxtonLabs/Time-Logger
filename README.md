# Time-Logger
Creates rough estimates of time worked.

Checks whether the user has done anything in the last minute. If so, increases the "minute worked" counter by one. Repeats this check every minute.

Currently only displays the time worked when the user presses "Stop" - adding a background worker so that the UI can be updated with the timer is the next step.
